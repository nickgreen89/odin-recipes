        <img src="../img/chicken.jpg" alt="Roast Chicken">

        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>With an ingredient list just four items long, the genius of this 
            bare-bones roast chicken is in its technique. To make it, thoroughly
            preheat a cast-iron skillet before sliding into it a seasoned bird, 
            breast side up. In under an hour you'll get a stunner of a chicken, 
            with moist, tender white meat, crisp, salty chicken skin, and juicy
            dark meat all done to a turn.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
            <li>1 whole chicken, 3 to 4 pounds</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Put a cast-iron skillet on a low rack in the oven and heat
                    it to 500 degrees. Rub the chicken all over with the oil and 
                    sprinkle it generously with salt and pepper.
                </li>
                <li>When the oven and skillet are hot, carefully put the chicken 
                    in the skillet, breast side up. Roast for 15 minutes, then 
                    turn the oven temperature down to 350 degrees. Continue to 
                    roast until the bird is golden brown and an instant-read 
                    thermometer inserted into the meaty part of the thigh reads 
                    155 to 165 degrees.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tip the pan to let the juices flow from the chicken's cavity
                    into the pan. Transfer the chicken to a platter and let it rest
                    for at least 5 minutes. Carve and serve. 
                </li>
            </ol>
