        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds tomatillos, husks and stems removed</li>
            <li>1 to 2 jalapeno or serrano peppers, stem and seeds removed</li>
            <li>1 small white onion, skin removed, cut in half</li>
            <li>1 bunch cilantro leaves and tender stems</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Combine tomatillos, serranos, and onion in a medium saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce to a simmer. Simmer until vegetables are completely softened, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure all sides are softened.</li>
                <li>Drain vegetables then transfer to a blender. Add cilantro and a large pinch of salt. Blend on medium speed until a chunky puree is formed, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a bowl, season to taste with more salt or lime juice if necessary, and serve. Cooled salsa can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.</li>
            </ol>
